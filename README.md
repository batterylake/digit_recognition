# digit_recognition
The project takes in 28 x 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits and correctly labels the digit with approxiamtely 96% accuracy. This was used as an educational project as a means of learning introductory neural network concepts including sigmoid neurons, stochaistic gradient descent, and backpropogation algorithms.



The neural network was constructed using guidelines and sample code provided in "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Micahel Nielsen
