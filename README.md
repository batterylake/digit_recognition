# digit_recognition
The project takes in 28 x 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits and correctly labels the digit with approxiamtely 96% accuracy. This was used as an educational project to learn introductory neural network concepts including sigmoid neurons, stochaistic gradient descent, and backpropogation algorithms.


The project consists of two .py files: the network file and MNIST data loader.


The neural network was constructed using guidelines and sample code provided in "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Micahel Nielsen
